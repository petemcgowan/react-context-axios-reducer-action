This is a very simple example/POC. It's like a reset, when bombarded with all the different ways to do this (Mobx, React, Typescript, functional vsclass, structure approaches).

This is fundamentally the setup one would go for. A dedicated context folder area per "concept" (src/contexts/User).

Features:

- React (not Typescript),
- functional components,
- React Hooks
- React Context
- "Axios Actions"
- Folder structure for React Context/Hooks generally (and axios calling)

It's possible State and Context should be merged, ymmv.
